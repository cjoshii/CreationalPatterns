# Creational Patterns

Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could lead to design problems or added complexity in the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation process.

### 1. [Abstract Factory](./AbstractFactory/)

Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 2. [Builder](./Builder/)

Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

### 3. [Factory Method](./FactoryMethod/)

Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

### 4. [Prototype](./Prototype/)

Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype.

### 5. [Singleton](./Singleton/)

Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
